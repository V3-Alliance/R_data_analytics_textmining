# R_data_analytics_textmining
Extracting, cleaning and analysing email content from a Request Tracker (RT) database.

The Request Tracker database may contain useful information for improving the responses of support staff.
This mini-project will use R to extract data from the MySQL tables,
removed HTML tages etc. and attempt to apply a clustering algorithm
to classify the support emails.
