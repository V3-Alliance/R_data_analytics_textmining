Build Instructions
------------------

Introduction
------------

This document explains how to build R scripts so they can be executed.
The "build" process is needed as some of the R scripts embed sensitive information
such as authentication information and API keys that should not be committed to GitHub.
Basically in a "build" sed is used to substitute the private information into placeholders
within the publicly visible R scripts.

The executable files in private/ MUST NOT be committed to git.
.gitignore is set up to avoid this.

Subject-line Sentiment
----------------------
 
The development version of the R script is found in word_count.
The development version of the BUILD script is found in word_count/bash
These files can be committed as they do not contain sensitive information.

To build the R script with the proper database credentials
cd into the private/bash directory and execute ./build_word_cloud.sh
The executable R file will be found in private/word_count

Cluster Analysis
----------------------
 
The development version of the R script is found in clustering.
The development version of the BUILD script is found in clustering/bash
These files can be committed as they do not contain sensitive information.

To build the R script with the proper database credentials
cd into the private/bash directory and execute ./build_clustering.sh
The executable R file will be found in private/clustering
